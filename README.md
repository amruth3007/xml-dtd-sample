# xml-dtd-sample
This repository includes sample implementation of dtd in xml.



DTD is a set of markup declarations that define a document type for an SGML-family markup language (SGML, XML, HTML).
A Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal building blocks of an XML document. 
It defines the document structure with a list of legal elements and attributes.




Thankyou.
